# ALACS - Apex Legends Automatic Character Selector

Someone wrote in some random chat that he'd/she'd like to have a random character selection option. This small program solves the problem.
I made this purely for the fun. This has been tested on a 1920:1080 monitor. Other resolutions might not be supported.

## DEMO

## HOW IT WORKS

1. Get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Zenahr/ALACS/releases/latest)
2. Unzip it somewhere on your machine
3. (Optional) change the activation key in `config.json` to your liking (`home` key is the default)
4. Start ALACS.exe
5. Start Apex Legends as usual
6. When in the selection screen, activate ALACS via the pre-defined activation key
7. voila! Your legend has been selected for you automatically
